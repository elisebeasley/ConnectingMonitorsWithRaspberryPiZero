This program was created by Elise Beasley, a sophomore at Yorktown High School, and Greg Rusk, a Computer Science
teacher at Yorktown High School.

Based on: network.py  2013 @whaleygeek

A program that creates a communication network between 2 rasp pi zw using an animation make by turtle. Because turtle
does not allow manipulation in a thread other than the main, this program uses a messaging method with queues to
indirectly call and edit turtle. This is an asynchronous input-output program and relies on data from another program
called final_my_turtle_rasp_pi_zw. The user must have 2 rasp pi zw connected to monitors or a way to input into the
terminals and view both screen animations using an application like VNC Viewer. When the user starts the program, they
must input the ip address of the other rasp pi zw, mode - either "first" or "second," and placement of the monitor -
either "left" or "right." Note that the "second" mode must be started BEFORE the "first" mode because it
must wait for input from the "first" mode. The placement of the monitors must be specified to have the ball start at
the correct position and bounce off the correct wall. The initial work for both the first and second modes are done
in their own threads so that the Turtle thread is not manipulated outside of the main loop.
